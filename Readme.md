## Net-Cat
This project consists on recreating the NetCat in a Server-Client Architecture that can run in a server mode on a specified port listening for incoming connections, and it can be used in client mode, trying to connect to a specified port and transmitting information to the server.

## To run the server
- Clone or download this repository
- Open the terminal 
- Run the following command:( go run . ) will have a default port of 8989, if you want to change it, you can run (go run. #port)

## To connect as a client
In linux terminal or WSL terminal for windows users run the following command:

nc <SERVER_IP> <PORT> 

- SERVER_IP: is the IP of the server given when u run it 
- PORT: is the port of the server 8989 or the one that u specified it
- When prompted, provide a username and thats it!
